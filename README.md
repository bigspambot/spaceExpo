# spaceExpo

This is a landing page for Love Space (fictional).

The background image is a gif from Giphy.

The logo has a border radius giving it a curved effect and the opacity allows for some transparency.

The font (nasalization) is from 1,001 Fonts.

The purple color was picked from the background using Coolers.

The title has a shadow making it stand out a little from the background.

I used a utility class (underline) in a span tag to underline 'exploration' with a bottom border.

The button is currently inactive.
